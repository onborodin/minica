 MiniCA is a web application for creating and managing X.509 certificates and private keys.

With MiniCA you can:

- Create or import pairs of root certificates and keys.
- Create and store encryptions and export a lot of user certificates.
- Revoke/unrevoke certificates.
- Create and export a revocation list.
- Use national symbols in certificate names.

The number of managed certificates is limited by your server hardware and your browser. I use this application to manage more than 3,000 corporate certificates.

Currently, the application version is beta, (maybe) requires some refinemenl but work well.
